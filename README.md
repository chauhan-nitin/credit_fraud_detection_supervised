# Welcome to Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Business Problem
It is vital that credit card companies are able to identify fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. Such problems can be tackled with Data Science and its importance, along with Machine Learning, cannot be overstated. This project intends to illustrate the modelling of a data set using machine learning with Credit Card Fraud Detection.

## Notebook Description
This notebook is fully written in Python 3.0 version. For each code chunk appropriate description is given. Although it is expected that the reader has a preliminary experience with Python. Regarding the methodologies used in this notebook, we always tried to provide a concise theoretical background. Now we are good to go. Let's start...
